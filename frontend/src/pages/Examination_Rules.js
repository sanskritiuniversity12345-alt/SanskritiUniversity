        <p>General guidelines for award of Grades are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Evaluation of different components of a Course Unit for each student shall be initially done in numerical marks.</li>
          <li>A Normal Class with a range of scores should be graded by a convenient method and should usually produce a fairly normal distribution of grades.</li>
          <li>Grading will be done on raw score awarded by the evaluator in all continuous assessment for Semester / Yearly based pattern.</li>
          <li>For award of D grade, the minimum percentage of marks shall not be less than 40% for UG & PG programmes and 35% for all diploma programmes.</li>
          <li>There is no boundation of scoring minimum marks in the Term I & Term – II Examinations but Student must score minimum of 30% in Term - III Examinations for scoring pass grade in the respective course.</li>
          <li>The results, if considered necessary, shall be moderated by a duly constituted Results Moderation Committee.</li>
          <li>The procedure for evaluation and award of grades for Project/Training /Seminar/ Comprehensive viva-voce shall be such as may be decided by the respective Board of Studies.</li>

        <p>In the case of Non-credit and Audit Courses which are not reckoned for assessment of SGPA and CGPA, the students shall be awarded "SC" (successfully completed) Grade for satisfactory performance and “NC” (not completed) Grade for unsatisfactory performance.</p>
        <p>The Semester performance of a student will be indicated as “Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA). The SGPA will be weighted average of Grade Points of all letter grades received by a student for all the Course units in the semester. The formula for Computing SGPA is given below:</p>
        <p><strong>SGPA = <br />
          (C₁G₁ + C₂G₂ + C₃G₃ + …) / (C₁ + C₂ + C₃ + …)</strong></p>
        <p>Where C1,C2,C3 denote credits associated with courses taken by the Student and G1,G2,G3 are the Grade Point of the letter grades awarded in the respective Course. An example of these calculations is given below:</p>

        <h3>Procedure for booking of cases of use of Unfair Means at the examination Centre</h3>
        <p><strong>Issuance of Second Answer Sheet</strong></p>
        <p>As soon as any case of unfair means comes to the notice of the Superintendent/ Invigilator of the examination centre, he shall take possession of the Answer Sheet of the candidate along with paper or other material found in his possession and provide the candidate with a second Answer Sheet immediately. On the top of the Answer Sheet it should be superscribed “Second Answer Sheet”. The Superintendent shall record on the first Answer Sheet the time when the case was brought to his notice. He shall also record the time on the second Answer Sheet when it was issued to the candidate.</p>

        <p><strong>Explanation of the candidate</strong></p>
        <p>While issuing the second Answer Sheet, the candidate shall be asked by the Centre Superintendent to submit his explanation in writing. In case the candidate refuses to give his statement, he should not be forced to do so, only the fact of his refusal should be recorded by the Invigilator(s) on duty at the time of occurrence and such a statement of the Invigilator(s) be attested by the Centre Superintendent.</p>

        <p><strong>Statement of the Invigilator</strong></p>
        <p>The Invigilator, who detects the use of UFM by a candidate, shall also record his statement which shall be verified and signed by the Centre Superintendent.</p>

        <p><strong>Material found from the candidate</strong></p>
        <p>As far as possible precise information as to from where the material was found (in the pocket, desk, shoes etc.) should be mentioned in the statement of the Invigilator(s). The copying material so detected by an Invigilator should also be signed by the Student and Invigilator and countersigned by the Centre Superintendent on each page and the total number of pages detected should be mentioned on the title of the Answer Sheet duly signed by the Invigilator and Centre Superintendent</p>

        <p><strong>Procedure to be followed in case of smuggling out an Answer Sheet</strong></p>
        <p>In case a candidate has smuggled out an answer Sheet, the Centre Superintendent should call for the candidate directly and try to secure the Answer Sheet. In case of non-availability of the Answer Sheet, the matter should be reported to the office of Controller of Examination along with the statement of the Invigilator present in the room and also of the candidate.</p>

        <p><strong>Other Cases of Unfair Means</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Impersonation</strong></p>
        <p>In case of impersonation, the Centre Superintendent should send to the Controller of Examination, the statement of the person found to be impersonating, the Invigilator(s) and the real candidate, if possible.</p>

        <p><strong>Documents required to be sent in UFM cases</strong></p>
        <p>All cases of UFM should be recorded in the prescribed form for reporting UFM cases. The form shall be accompanied by the following documents:</p>
