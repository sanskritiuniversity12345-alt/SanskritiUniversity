        <p className="mb-4">
          The list of private universities in India and smaller private colleges in Delhi NCR &amp; UP belt is a long one. Therefore zeroing in on the right kind of institution could be a tricky task.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In their college search, students are greatly aided by independent private university rankings in India. It makes their college search process more data based and thereby more accurate. The top ranking universities in India too greatly benefit from college rankings India because the true picture of the strongest institutions emerges clearly and fairly.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Sanskriti has improved its rankings, year over year, to arrive at a spot where it can confidently stand out in the list of top ranking universities in India. It has sustained a prime spot in the college rankings India thereby becoming a popular answer to student’s college search question. The list of private universities in India is bewilderingly long and Sanskriti had started at the bottom of the college ranking pyramid. Notably, the pace with which it has climbed up the private university rankings in India is promising and encouraging.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A note of caution here is that the private university ranking in India can be misleading and often forged. Therefore, aspiring students should perform due diligence by checking the credentials of the issuer of the private university ranking in India or anywhere else for that matter. Moreover, the list of private colleges in Delhi NCR and across the nation, which have been ranked by a credible issuer, is not very long. Therefore it’s a wise college search strategy to witness the campuses first hand and talk to the alumni.
